# Assignment Instructions

Create a PowerPoint file with **7 slides** – **one slide per well**.  
On each slide include the following items:

1. **Well identifier/name**  
2. **Type of well** – clearly state whether it is a *producer* well or an *injector* well.  
3. **Starting date** of the well’s data  
4. **Ending date** of the well’s data  
5. A plot that illustrates any **missing values** in the dataset for that well (e.g. a heat‑map, flag plot, etc.).  
6. A short paragraph or bullet points describing **how you would handle the missing values** (imputation strategy, delete rows, interpolation, model‑based filling, etc.).

You may begin with a title slide if you wish, but the core requirement is seven content slides, one per well, with the details above. Be sure each slide is clearly labelled with the well name and contains the required dates, plot and commentary on missing data handling.

Good luck!
